**Two pointers Algorithm**

The two pointers approach is a common algorithmic technique used in array or linked list manipulation problems. It involves using two pointers to traverse the data structure in a specific way, often leading to a more efficient solution compared to a naive approach.

**Algo**

1.  initialize two pointers that start at different positions in the array or data structure.
2.  Use a loop  to traverse the array or data structure. The loop conditions are usually based on the relative positions of the two pointers. The loop continues until the pointers meet or cross each other.
3.  At each step of the loop, compare the elements or values pointed to by the two pointers, or perform certain operations based on the problem's constraints. These comparisons and operations determine how the pointers are adjusted.
4.  Based on the comparisons or operations, move one or both pointers in a specific direction (usually left or right). The goal is to gradually approach the solution or desired outcome by manipulating the pointers.
5.  The loop terminates when the pointers meet or cross each other. This might happen when they have covered the entire array or when a specific condition is met.
6.  If the problem requires finding a specific solution or output, perform the necessary actions when the pointers meet or when the loop terminates.

```
function twoPointersAlgorithm(array):
    start = 0
    end = array.length - 1
    
    while start < end:
        // Compare or manipulate elements pointed to by start and end
        // Adjust pointers based on the problem's conditions
        
        if condition_met:
            // Handle solution or output
            return result
        
        // Move pointers
        start++
        end--
    
    // If solution not found
    return not_found

// Call the algorithm with the appropriate input
result = twoPointersAlgorithm(inputArray)

```

Remember that the actual implementation details, such as the specific comparisons, pointer movements, and solution handling, will vary based on the problem you're solving. The key idea is to efficiently navigate through the data structure using two pointers and adjust them in a way that leads to the desired solution.
